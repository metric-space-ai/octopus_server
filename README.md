# Octopus Server

[Octopus Server](https://github.com/metric-space-ai/octopus_server) is a central part of the [Octopus Software](https://github.com/metric-space-ai/octopus). It provides basic infrastructure and communication interfaces for all parts of the software.

## Octopus Server's high-level features

Octopus Server provides the following features:
- Chat features.
- Communication interface to OpenAI/Azure OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama LLMs. It has support for almost 300 LLM models.
- Data privacy. It makes sure that user private or company-sensitive data will not be accidentally sent to third-party LLMs.
- It allows running Python-based Octopus AI Services that enhance system capabilities with additional, customized AI models.
- It allows users to generate, with the use of LLM, their own custom AI Service that will be running together with other Octopus AI Services.
- Administrator is allowed to upload own custom AI Services. All AI services are scanned for malicious code patterns to prevent installation of the services that would have malicious features.
- It allows running TypeScript-based Octopus WASP Applications that enhance chat experience with UI applications that can communicate with LLMs and can provide additional business logic and features.
- It allows users to generate, with the use of LLM, their own custom WASP Applications that will be running together with other Octopus WASP Applications.
- Administrator is allowed to upload own custom WASP Applications. All WASP Applications are scanned for malicious code patterns to prevent installation of the applications that would have malicious features.
- It allows running HTML/CSS/JS-based Octopus HTML Applications that enhance system capabilities.
- Administrator is allowed to upload own custom HTML Applications. All HTML Applications are scanned for malicious code patterns to prevent installation of the applications that would have malicious features.
- It provides internal, built-in system commands that can be called from the chat level like Octopus AI Services.
- Role-based privileges system that allows separation of public and private chat activities depending on user roles.
- Chat tokens audits. Allows the administrator to check LLM tokens usage.
- User files allow users to store their work in files that could be used in different chat sessions.
- Prompting agents allow users to schedule LLM prompts for automating their workflows and repetitive tasks.
- Task Assignment System allows supervisors to create tasks and tests for the users that are automatically checked for completion by AI.
- It allows to suggest which LLM and model should be used to answer particular questions during chat session.
